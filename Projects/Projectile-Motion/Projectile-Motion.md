# Calculate the distance traveled by a projectile `(30pts)`

<!-- ## [Select a projectile weapon](https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/phatcat/lists/modern-military-weapons/27505/) -->
## [Select a projectile weapon](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons)
* Find the cartridge calibre for the weapon you selected. eg. 5.56 for an M4
<!-- * Find the muzzle velocity for the weapon. -->
* Select a round from the ammunition types.
* Find the projectile velocity of your selected round.
<!-- * Find the weight of the bullet. It is available as part of the description available for the ammunition. If it is not, google it. -->


# [Select a building you're going to fire it from](https://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings/country/100193/puerto-rico)
Create an script to calculate your weight in space.
* Define a function that accept a planet and your mass as parameters. 
* Print your weight in that planet.
* You may use any other building 

[Use this website to review projectile motion. Example 1 will help.](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/two-dimensional-motion/two-dimensional-projectile-mot/a/what-is-2d-projectile-motion)


Name the file using the following convention `Name-Lastname-Projectile.py`

Solve for time using your initial height and vertical velocity. Assume we are firing this round at an angle of 0 degrees(no angle). We are only exerting a velocity on x.`(20pts)`
* Your script must solve for time(t).
* Your script must Calculate delta X.
* Your script must be fully documented.

After you finish, take a screenshot of the terminal and name it using the following convention: `Name-Lastname-Space.png`
