# API Calls
* Your script must be fully documented (`# Inline documentation at every step`).

### Select the API you will be using from [Random Data API](https://random-data-api.com/documentation) `(15 pts)`
* Store a sample JSON in the project folder. It must be named after the API you've selected eg. `random_address.json`
* Format the document. Do so by right clicking on VS Code and selecting the `Format Document` option. Alternatively `Alt+Shift+f` will work.
* Commit the file.


### Create a class for the request. `(15 pts)`
Recall when we made a class called `ExperimentData` in Projectile-Motion. Create a class in your project folder named after your API Object. eg. `RandomAddress.py` or simply `Address.py`
* Include all variables in the constructor.
* Define the data types in the constructor parameter list.
* Commit the file.

<br>

# Load a file: `(20 pts)`
* Create a file named `FileDeserialization.py`
* Load the created JSON file into the Class.
* Print each variable by addressing the class.



```python
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path
from RandomAddress import RandomAddress

#  Locate and open file
myPath = Path(__file__).parents[0]
myFilePath = os.path.join(myPath, 'random_address.json')
data = open(myFilePath,)
 
# deserializing the data
data = json.load(data)
address:RandomAddress = RandomAddress(**data)

# Print data from the object
print(f"ID: {address.id}")
print(f"UID: {address.uid}")
print(f"Street Name: {address.street_name}")
print(f"Longitude: {address.longitude}")
print("Others expected...")
```

<br>

# Deserialize a request. `(20 pts)`

* Create a file named `RequestDeserialization.py`
* Load the fetched JSON file into the Class.

[How to use urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html)

```python
import json, ssl
import urllib.request
from RandomAddress import RandomAddress

# This is discouraged but it will avoid certificate validation (prevents error)
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

# This is the URL from which we will request the data
addressURL = "https://random-data-api.com/api/address/random_address?size=100"

# Create a list to populate with our data
addresses:RandomAddress = [] 

# Execute HTTP Request
req = urllib.request.Request(addressURL)
requestData = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(req).read())

# Loop over JSON items and Deserialize them into python objects
for r in requestData:  
    # Deserialize 
    address:RandomAddress = RandomAddress(**r)
    # Add object to list
    addresses.append(address) 
    # Print id
    print(address.id)
```

# Store Requests `(30 pts)`
* [Programmatically create a folder](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-directory-in-python/) within your project folder named `responses`.
* Store 10,000 requests into this folder. Use separate files for each record.
* Do not commit these files. Add `Projects/Web-Servers/responses` to your `.gitignore`.
* You must show the code fetching the records and storing them to your professor in order to gain these points.
