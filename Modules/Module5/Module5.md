## If-else logic
One of the most common statements in programming is the `if` statement. It is often followed by an `else` statement. If statement evaluate boolean propositions and execute code depending on the propositional statement response. An `else` statement is used when you would like another piece of code when the code fails. An `elif` (else if) statement may be used when you'd like a piece of code to run when an alternate condition IS met. An example using a mathematical proposition is displayed below.

```python
x = 45

if(x == 0):
    print("The value of x is 0")
elif(x > 50):
  print("The value of x is more than 50")
else:
    print("The value of x is lower than 50, and is not 0")
```

## Implement a rock-paper-scissors game using if-else logic.`(20pts)`
* Create a file called `RockPaperScissors.py`
* Create an array with all 3 possible values.
* Use an `input()` to enter the value you'd like to select.
* Have your opponent select a random value from this list by a code similar to the one below:


```python
import random

foo = ['firstValue', 'secondValue', 'anotherValue']
computerChoice = random.choice(foo)
print(f"Computer selected: {computerChoice}")

# Add logic below this line
```

 - Answers:
   - OR: X = 35
   if(x > 20 or x < 30)
    print("your number is 25"):
   - AND: candies = 6
   if(candies > 7 or < 5 )
  print("you have little candies"):
   - NOT: X = 32
   if not (x > 29 and x < 32):
    print("Your number is 32"):
