## If-else logic
One of the most common statements in programming is the `if` statement. It is often followed by an `else` statement. If statement evaluate boolean propositions and execute code depending on the propositional statement response. An `else` statement is used when you would like another piece of code when the code fails. An `elif` (else if) statement may be used when you'd like a piece of code to run when an alternate condition IS met. An example using a mathematical proposition is displayed below.

```python
x = 45

if(x == 0):
    print("The value of x is 0")
elif(x > 50):
  print("The value of x is more than 50")
else:
    print("The value of x is lower than 50, and is not 0")
```

## Implement a rock-paper-scissors game using if-else logic.`(20pts)`
* Create a file called `RockPaperScissors.py`
* Create an array with all 3 possible values.
* Use an `input()` to enter the value you'd like to select.
* Have your opponent select a random value from this list by a code similar to the one below:


```python
import random

foo = ['firstValue', 'secondValue', 'anotherValue']
computerChoice = random.choice(foo)
print(f"Computer selected: {computerChoice}")

# Add logic below this line
```

## Upload a screenshot of the full output produced by running `RockPaperScissors.py` `(1pts)`
* ### Use the name format: `CSI-Name-Lastname-5.png`
* ### Store it within your Module5 directory.
* ### Commit and push the file before next class.

Give a python example for each logic operator in the module image.

 - Answers:
   - OR: used if the code you want to execute only needs one of several values to be true in order to execute. for instance, if you want to write code to check if it is the weekend, you would write the following:
   if (day == "saturday" or day == "sunday"):
    print("It is the weekend")
  else:
    print("It is a weekday")
   - AND: used if the code you want to execute needs multiple values to be true in order to execute. for instance, if you want to check if a grade is in the range to be a B, you would write:
   if (grade >= 80 and grade < 90): # in this case, a B is 
                                    # assumed to be an average 
                                    # of 80-89
    print("Your grade is a B")
  else:
    print("Your grade is not a B")
   - NOT: this operator is used if a code should execute only if a specific value is not true. For instance, to check if a number is odd, you would write
   if not ( num % 2 == 0): # this is assuming the value is an int
    print("The number is odd")
  else:
    print("The number is even")
