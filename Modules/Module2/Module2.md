# Module 2: Using Visual Studio Code

### Create a commit merging master into your current branch. `(1pts)`

<br>

## What is [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

<br>

### Open Visual Studio Code. Make sure that it is your working directory of the course.

1. Go to `File` > `Open Folder`
2. Select the directory you've cloned your repository into `(CSI-Python-2021)`. 

<br>

### The first thing you will see on the left-most side of visual studio code is the file system for the course.

        title="Files available on the directory may vary from the time of the screenshot" 
        width="60%" 
        height="60%" />

<br>

### On the bottom of your screen is the Terminal. Through here you may communicate directly with your computer's Operating System. If you do not see it click on `Terminal` > `New Terminal` on your top menu.

# Communicate with Console

[*Some commands vary on the Mac Shell.*](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/)

## Lets start by navigating through directories 
### Type the following commands into your console


* `dir` will Show contents of current directory
 
* `cd ..` will take you back one directory. It stands for change directory.

* `cd CSI-Python-2021` will bring you back to the project directory (Assuming you went back one directory in the step before)

***(Hint)** After typing "`cd`" into the console, you may hit the `TAB` key to run through the options available in the directory. It also works as an auto-complete shortcut.*

* `cd Modules\Module2` will move you from
> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021

to 

> C:\Users\user\Documents\CSI-Python-2021\Modules\Module2

<br>


# Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Correctly`(1pts)`
### Run Python Installer
   - [X] Add Python to PATH

* *You may need to close and open Visual Studio after Installation.*

* *If prompted for Python Extensions, select to Install.*

* *Python for Visual Studio on Mac requires Developer Tools. Install them when prompted.*


<br>

# Interact with Python.

Python should have been installed and added to PATH. To verify this run: `python --version` and receive an output of:
 
>Python 3.9.6

<br>

## Open the Python Console

Typing `python` *(or `python3`)* into the terminal will enter the Python console:

> Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>
> \>\>\>

`print("Hello World!")` will run a simple python command that returns whichever string of text you have encapsulated into your double quotes. In this case 
> Hello World!

`exit()` will bring you back into your Operating System's console.

<br>

## Execute Python Script
### Navigate to the Module2 directory and type: `python HelloWorld.py`. This will execute a python script.

### The output should look similar to this:

<img    src="Module2-1.png" 
        title="HelloCarlos!" 
        width="80%" 
        height="80%" />

### Take a screenshot of your terminal's output showing the same elements as above. 
* #### On Windows use `WIN+SHFT+S` to make a selection.
* #### Save it in the <u>Module2</u> directory of your branch. 
* #### Name the file using the following convention: `Module2-1.png`


### Commit and push this image before the next lecture`(2pts)`

# Class Discussion
## Answer the questions on the Markdown file located within your `Module2` directory (Module2.md). `(4pts)`

<!-- Welcome! These are your questions. -->
<!-- Answer using full sentences to receive all points. -->
<!-- 

What is a benefit of using Markdown?
https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/

 - Answer: Markdown is more versatile than other text formats such as Microsoft Word. It can be used for any computer text-based application, independent of the platform, works regardless of the application, making it future proof, and is supported on many different websites.

What does "cd" stand for?

 - Answer: change directory, which is why it is the command used to move between files on a repository.

Did you get stuck at any point or become confused with your console? (yes/no) If so, what happened? How did you solve it?

 - Answer: I had a problem when using python in the console, which I circumvented by running Python through VS Code's run button, rather than using the terminal.

Did you consider searching google for other commands to run? What did you try? 

 - Answer: I did not try any commands aside from cd or python, as they were not relevant to what I was doing. However, I was already familiar with the cd command for searching through files in the terminal from prior experience with Git Bash.

What would you like to program? 

 - Answer: I would like to write robotics-related programs, such as those that directly relate to robotic functions such as their movement or sensors, as well as any potential artificial intelligence that the robot would need for its functions, such as in reacting to stimuli that it receives through its sensors.
